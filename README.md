# language-test

Repo to experiment with building an app that has a different language for certain screens.

This would allow you to have certain journeys in different languages.

Current progress: this works when you launch a new activity (`SecondActivity`), but it does not work for new fragments (`ThirdFragment`) at the moment.

Notes:
* Requires Java 11
